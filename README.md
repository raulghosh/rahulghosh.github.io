## Welcome to my personal webpage

### I like solving pressing problems. My professional journey began in the financial markets in 2011. For me they were and still are one of the most interesting problems to solve. The only difference now is that technology has enabled us to solve some equalling pressing and challenging problems which once were thought to be too complex to be attempted by a machine.

### I love finding problems and solving them. In my opinion AI and machine learning have unleased a new wave of value creation.  With that assumption I have set sail on a journey expecting to quench my thirst for curiousity.
