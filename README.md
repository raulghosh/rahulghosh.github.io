## Welcome to my personal webpage

### I like solving problems to create value and generate revenue. I worked in the financial services industries for almost a decade. From deploying capital as a trader to serving clients as a fixed income and currencies salesman, I was always involved in high stake decision making roles.

### Long time ago, one of my university professor taught me an important lesson. 

### Productivity = Natural Resource x Human Effort^Tools. 

### I consider a huge part of human being's success comes from knowing and utilizing tools. With that in mind I decided to equip myself with the tools of AI and ML.

### I hope this page will eventually become a diary of my skillset where with each passing year I will look back and say...damn! was I that bad?
